#About

Message in a bottle project for codeninja competition.
The server is written using Node.JS and is in the file server.js. The file package.json gives the dependencies needed to build the server using NPM.
The client is under the static folder. It's hosted on the server using Nginx.
The folder etc has some configuration files for our debian server.
